            <br />
            I am currently a Junior at DeVry University and majoring in Computer Information Systems <br />
            with a concentration in Web Development and Administration.  Professionally, I work at a <br />
            hospital in Information Systems as an HL7 Interface Engineer.  I have been working in IT for <br />
            the past 5 years at Decatur Memorial Hospital.  I often find myself voluntarily taking on <br />
            challenging projects and troubleshooting issues that most people try to avoid as I am always <br />
            looking for opportunities to learn and grow as much as possible.  I strive to be a full stack <br />
            developer but I also excel in a team environment where I am able to communicate effectively <br />
            and efficiently with others.  I am able to fit into any role requested or needed of me in a team <br />
            setting whether it be leadership, mentorship, or just simply a dependable team member that others <br />
            can trust to get their work completed in an accurate and timely manner.  I personally thrive in <br />
            high pressure and high volume workloads and can keep a level head in the most stressful of times. <br />
            I try to grow and learn <em>everyday</em> in a <em>all</em> facets of life and keep an optimistic  outlook with the <br />
            philosophy that anything can be turned into a learning experience and that as long as we learn <br />
             and grow from our mistakes, nothing is a failure.
